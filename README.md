## Setup of the environment

cd setup
```

Then run the setup script using following commands:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
source setup.sh
```

After that navigate to the main/src directory and run `main.py` file using python that you have at your disposal, that would be:
```bash
cd ../src # or cd ./src if you are currently in the main project directory
python main.py
```

### Windows 

Run setup.bat or setup.ps1 script (it should work by double-clicking either of them), then in the same terminal navigate to \src directory and run the main project file with, like so:
```bat
cd ..\src
python main.py
```
